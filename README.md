## About
Kiko Guide is a plugin written for the [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) framework which allows players to easily access guides to in-game duty content. 

Features
- Can automatically open when entering a supported duty
- Tables of key mechanics each boss, with categories that can be easily hidden.
- A "shortened strategy" mode, making all guides essentially a TL:DR of the fight.
- Plugin & Guide localization support
- Localizations & Guides update independantly of the core plugin.

## Installing
Currently, it is not recommended you install Kiko Guide as it has not been merged into the DalamudPlugins official repository. 

If you still wish to install the plugin anyway (and this should only be for testing purposes) then add the following link to your 3rd-party repositories in the Dalamud settings.

```
