## About
Kiko Guide is a plugin written for the [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) framework which allows players to easily access guides to in-game duty content. 

Features
- Automatically open the duty guide upon entering it.
- Lists of all key boss mechanics with configurable visability
- Shortened strategy mode for at a glance viewing
- Full localization support
- Self updating guides independant of plugin feature updates¹

¹ Some guides may require a plugin update to view if they have significant changes

## Installing
Kiko Guide will hopefully be available for download through the official DalamudPlugins repository in the near-feature.

Until then, if you really wish to install a developer preview release of the plugin, you can add the following repository URL to your 3rd-party repositories `(Dalamud Plugins -> Settings -> Experimental -> Custom Plugin Repositories)`

```
