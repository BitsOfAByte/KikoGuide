Features
- Automatically open the duty guide upon entering it.
- Lists of all key boss mechanics with configurable visability
- Shortened strategy mode for at a glance viewing
- Full localization support
- Self updating guides independant of plugin feature updates¹

¹ Some guides may require a plugin update to view if they have significant changes

## Installing
A test build of Kiko Guide is currently available on the Dalamud official repository. To install it currently, you will have to enable "Get Plugin Testing Builds" under `Settings -> Experimental`. A stable build for KikoGuide should be available soon.

Bleeding edge builds will still be published on the custom repo below, however it is *highly unrecommended* to use this builds as they may be unstable and cause issues with your game.
