            "TLDR": "Stand near towers when targetted with single attack, avoid them otherwise.",
            "Strategy": "The key components of this fight are the four statues in the room. When a red marker appears above your head, run behind a statue immediately. If you do not, he will spawn a tether that deals massive DoT and applies a debuff.\n\nAnchag should be tanked in the middle of the room as he will do several AoEs that can destroy the statues prematurely.\n\nRanged DPS and healers should also be careful as he will target players at random for an AoE, which can destroy statues. If he targets you for a rush attack, stay away from the statues, as this attack will immediately destroy them. Instead, move closer to the boss, which reduces the damage dealt."
