The "Base" Directory is where all critical Plugin functionality is handled.

Some examples of things you can find here are Window Management, Command Management, Resource Managment and Configuration.

Classes included here are split away from the "Managers" directory as they are more focused on providing core Plugin functionality and are not specific to the Plugin itself for the most part.
