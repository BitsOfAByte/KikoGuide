The "Base" Directory is where all critical Plugin functionality is handled.

Some examples of things you can find here are Window Management, Command Management, Resource Managment, Configuration and Resource Management.

Classes included here are split away from the "Managers" directory as they are more focused on providing core Plugin functionality.
